What logic governs the transition of the 'fast' pointer in an array cycle problem?,$fast = array[array[fast]]$.
Why is 'Relative Speed' important for cycle detection?,It ensures that the distance between the two pointers changes at a constant rate until it becomes zero within a loop.

"In a Linked List with no cycle, what happens to the fast pointer?",It reaches the end of the list (null) twice as fast as the slow pointer.
Cloze: The Fast & Slow Pointer pattern is often used for _____ discovery in linear structures.,structural
Cloze: Using a Set to detect a cycle uses _____ space complexity.,$O(n)$
Cloze: Fast and slow pointers typically begin at the _____ node.,same (or head)
What is the primary reason the Fast & Slow Pointer algorithm is preferred over the Set-based approach?,It reduces Space Complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$.
"If the distance between Fast and Slow pointers in a cycle is $k$, and Fast moves 2 steps while Slow moves 1, what is the distance after one iteration?",$k-1$.
Why does a relative speed of 1 step guarantee the pointers will meet in a cycle?,The distance between them decreases by exactly one node each iteration until they collide.
List three specific applications of the Fast & Slow Pointer pattern mentioned in the material.,"Cycle detection, finding the middle node, and cycle length calculation."
"In the provided code template, what check is performed immediately after moving the pointers?",Check if 'slow == fast' to identify a meeting point.
How is 'structural discovery' contrasted with 'comparison' tasks?,Structural discovery uses Fast/Slow pointers to find loops/midpoints; comparison tasks (like finding a target sum) use standard Two Pointers.
What is the 'Full Circle' intuition described for Fast & Slow pointers?,"Even if one pointer moves much faster, they will eventually meet if the path is circular."
"In cycle detection, why must we check 'fast != null' before 'fast.next != null'?",To avoid a null pointer exception when trying to access the 'next' property of a null object.
Describe the movement of the 'fast' pointer in a 'Process/Sequence' format.,Node $\rightarrow$ Next Node $\rightarrow$ Next-Next Node (skipping one node).
Identify the purpose of the statement 'fast = head.next.next' in a conceptual manual trace.,It moves the fast pointer forward by two nodes from the head.
What happens in the 'Cycle Length' algorithm after the pointers meet?,"Keep one pointer at the meeting point and move the other node by node until it returns to the meeting point, counting steps."
"When finding the midpoint of an even-length list, where does the slow pointer typically land?","At the end of the first half or the start of the second half, depending on the specific implementation."
What terminology is used to describe the Set-based cycle detection approach?,Brute force logic.
"In the Fast & Slow Pointer algorithm, why can we not compare pointers immediately at initialization?","Because they both start at the same node, making the 'slow == fast' condition true before they have actually moved."
What is the consequence of the fast pointer's speed being twice that of the slow pointer for midpoint finding?,"When Fast reaches $N$, Slow is at $\frac{N}{2}$."
