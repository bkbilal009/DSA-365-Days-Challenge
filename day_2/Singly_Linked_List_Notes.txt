A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of
elements called nodes. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous
memory locations, linked list nodes are scattered throughout memory and
connected using pointers or references.

Core Concepts of a Linked List • The Node: The fundamental building
block, typically divided into two partitions: one for data (values like
integers, names, or objects) and another for the address/reference of
the next node. • The Head: A reference variable that points to the first
node in the list; it is the starting point for accessing any
information. • Dynamic Nature: Linked lists can grow or shrink during
runtime, meaning you can allocate memory only when needed without
knowing the size in advance. • Sequential Access: You cannot jump
directly to a specific index (random access) like you can with an array;
you must traverse the list from the head, node by node.

  Implementing a Singly Linked List in Python

  1. The Node Class

  class Node: def init(self, info, next_node=None): self.data = info
  self.next = next_node

  2. The Singly Linked List Class

  class SinglyLinkedList: def init(self): self.head = None
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Operations Implementation

Insertion at the End

def insert_at_end(self, value): new_node = Node(value) if self.head is
None: self.head = new_node return temp = self.head while temp.next is
not None: temp = temp.next temp.next = new_node

Insertion at the Beginning

def insert_at_beginning(self, value): new_node = Node(value)
new_node.next = self.head self.head = new_node

Deletion

def delete_node(self, value): temp = self.head if temp is not None and
temp.data == value: self.head = temp.next return prev = None while temp
is not None and temp.data != value: prev = temp temp = temp.next if temp
is None: return prev.next = temp.next

Traversal

def print_list(self): temp = self.head while temp: print(temp.data,
end=” -> “) temp = temp.next print(”None”)
